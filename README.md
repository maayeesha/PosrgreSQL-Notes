# PosrgreSQL-Notes
Summary of Learning outcomes 


## What is a database?
A database is a place where you can store, manipulate & retrieve data.Data is stored in tables in a database.

## What is a relational database?
A database with one or more relations between tables.

## What is SQL?
SQL(Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for communicating with database.It helps us to manage data held in a relational database.

## What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL/Postgres is a free relational database management system. 

## Why learn PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is very popular among data scientists & other professionals working with data. It's free & easy to learn.

# [**Here**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/installation.html) is how you can install PostgreSQL in your computer!

## How to connect to a database?
 * GUI client (not preferred even though it's easier way)
 * Using the Terminal/Command Line (Preferred because it lets you learn all the commands that your database requires to manipulate data)
 * Application (Writing a server site application & connect it to the database)
 
## What is database server & client?
A database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the clientâ€“server model.The database client is a software that is used to connect with the database server and perform operations on the data. Many different types of database clients can connect with a database server.
The database client software can be desktop based or web based. It can be simple or extremely complex. It can be a GUI based client or a command based client. It can be a free or paid software.

## IDE
* Datagrip (best but paid; [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datagrip/installation-guide.html#snap) is how you can install Datagrip)
* Postico (Free; Only for Mac users (https://eggerapps.at/postico/,"here") is how you can install Postico)
* pgAdmin (Free; Available for windows users)

## Set up PSQL (for windows)

# How to generate data without inserting them manually?
- Download the SQL database (Check out [this website](https://www.mockaroo.com/) for random data generation)
- use **\i 'filepath'** command 



# [Data Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.htm) in PostgreSQL

# UNIQUE Constraints
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
SELECT column_name COUNT() FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING COUNT() > 1; - Helps the user to find a Duplicate 

# How to export query results to CSV?
- \copy table_name TO 'file path' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER ; 

# Notes:
- If a row already exists and has a primary key, manually inserting data in the same row will result in duplicate key violation.
- Constraints mean whether it's primary key,foreign key etc.
- Foreign keys can be only assigned when there is a relation between two tables
